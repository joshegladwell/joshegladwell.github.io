    "text": "I am a data scientist professional from Sacramento, California. In December 2023 I completed my MS in Data Science and Analytics from Georgetown University. As an undergraduate, I attended Brigham Young University and double-majored in Statistics (with an emphasis in data science) and Russian. I chose Russian as one of my majors because I lived in Ukraine for two years as a church missionary immediately after finishing high school. I learned Russian during that time by speaking with strangers on a daily basis, which led to my deep love for the language and for Slavic culture.\nMy interest in data science started during my undergraduate education when I attended a university forum featuring Dr. DJ Patil—the former United States Chief Data Scientist under the Obama Administration. His remarks on the power of data to solve social problems in the world inspired me to pursue a career in data science. I am especially interested in this application of data science—addressing social problems through data.\nAside from my academic interests, I love watching movies, collecting LEGO, going on runs, and reading. I am a deep thinker and an inquisitive learner. I am inspired by the illuminating works of Russian authors who comment on human suffering, teaching me to care deeply about social disparities."

    "text": "Cherry blossoms near Tidal Basin in Washington, DC\n\n\n\nIntroducing my new blog\nWelcome to Musings: A Blog! My hope for this blog is to have a place where I can do mini data science projects on anything that interests me. Although I expect the content of this blog to have some level of technicality (for example, building machine learning models and cleaning messy datasets), I plan to use this blog as a more writing-heavy medium. As much as possible, I want it to be an outlet for my creativity more than a scientific project.\nWithout spoiling too much, some of my ideas for future blog posts include examination of DC’s famous cherry blossoms, features of LEGO Star Wars sets, water levels of the Great Salt Lake, and dialogue from my favorite show, Twin Peaks.\nI expect that the frequency of my posts will be highly irregular as I am working towards my master’s degree in data science and analytics for the next year, but my goal for now is to release at least one post every few months. This project is more for myself than for anyone else, but anybody is more than welcome to join me in my musings!"
