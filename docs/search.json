I learned Russian during that time by speaking with strangers on a daily basis, which led to my deep love for the language and for Slavic culture.\nMy interest in data science started during my undergraduate education when I attended a university forum featuring Dr. DJ Patil—the former United States Chief Data Scientist under the Obama Administration. His remarks on the power of data to solve social problems in the world inspired me to pursue a career in data science. I am especially interested in this application of data science—addressing social problems through data.\nAside from my academic interests, I love watching movies, collecting LEGO, going on runs, and reading.

    "text": "Introduction\nUtah’s Great Salt Lake is rapidly declining due to agricultural overconsumption, demands of the growing population, and climate change.1 In addition to failing a long-standing ecosystem,2 the decline also exposes toxic elements such as arsenic and mercury on the dried-up lakebed to wind that could carry the chemicals into the highly-populated surrounding areas.3 It’s a serious concern that poses severe consequences for the state of Utah.\nResearchers, legislators, and others have posed many solutions to save the lake. However, the lake itself maintains a highly complicated balance of systems, which in turn complicates the possible solutions. For example, in 1959, Union Pacific built a railroad causeway across the width of the lake (from east to west), splitting the lake into a North Arm and a South Arm. Figure 1 shows the color difference between the lighter South Arm and the darker, almost red North Arm. Because the North Arm averages between 26-30% salinity compared to the 12-15% salinity of the South Arm,4 the North Arm contains high populations of halophiles and algae, giving it its reddish color. Some have suggested cutting off the already limited flow between the North Arm and South Arm as a solution to save the lake, but others view this as a way to prolong the inevitability of the lake’s decline.5 Other proposed solutions have included use of artificial clouds, pipelines, and groundwater extractions, but most scholars agree that the only viable solution is to establish legislation that enacts major water conservation efforts.6 As solutions are discussed among researchers and legislators, some may argue that any efforts are already too late. The lake’s water loss has accelerated since 2020 and if no action is taken to stop the accelerated rate, the lake is projected to dry up by 2028.7"

    "text": "History of Great Salt Lake\nIn order to understand the significance of the lake’s current decline, it is important to understand several aspects of the lake’s history.\nFigure 2 below illustrates the Great Salt Lake’s recorded water elevation in feet above NGVD 1929 since 1966. At first glance, one may wonder why the low water elevation of today is such a concern when it appears to have had the same level in the 1960s. At this time, Great Salt Lake was indeed facing a similar fate when several years of unprecedented rainfall happened to save the lake. The bottom plot of Figure 2 features the change in water elevation in 1986, one of the highest-elevation years for the lake. This is a key year in that it brought flooding to the lake and showed the world what the lake could look like at a modern-day full capacity. However, archaeological evidence suggests that this magnitude of rainfall hadn’t occurred in the Salt Lake Valley for roughly one thousand years,8 underscoring the need to pursue acts of conservation rather than waiting for rain.9\nComparing the water level from the 1960s to now, it is also important to understand that the Great Salt Lake is a relatively shallow lake with a maximum depth of roughly 33 feet.10 This makes it especially sensitive to small changes in its water levels. Furthermore, one should bear in mind the natural underwater shape of lakes. Lakes are generally bowl-shaped, which is significant in that the difference between a foot of water elevation represents much more water volume at higher levels than at lower levels. Compare this, for example, to a box-shaped swimming pool, where the difference in a foot of water elevation at the bottom of the pool versus the top of the pool is roughly the same. Thus, changes in water elevations at lower levels of the lake are far more difficult to ameliorate than elevation changes at higher levels.\nOne of the most important elements of Figure 2 is the seasonality shown in the top plot. Each summer, the water elevation drops due to high evaporation in the dry season, followed by high precipitation in the winter (in the form of snow). As the snow melts going into spring, the runoff usually refills the lake each year. In the periods of time when the lake is in decline, it is usually declining as a result of less runoff water refilling the lake in the spring months. This supports the claims that overconsumption of runoff water is the leading factor in the lake’s decline.11\n\n\n\n                        \n                                            \n\n\nFigure 2: Interactive line plots illustrating the change in Great Salt Lake’s water elevation (ft above NGVD 1929). The top plot shows all recorded change, while the bottom plot shows change over the course of a year. Official measurements on the lake’s water levels began April 15th, 1966. Measurement frequency switched from bimonthly to daily on October 1st, 1989. Also included are two reference lines. The maroon line (set at 4,196.36 ft elevation)12 indicates the estimated lake elevation at which toxic dust and sediment are no longer covered by water, thus becoming vulnerable to winds potentially carrying the chemicals into the surrounding communities. The blue line (set at 4,191 ft)13 indicates the estimated lake elevation at which the salinity rises beyond that of a healthy environment for brine shrimp.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 also features two key elements in the story of Great Salt Lake’s decline. Years of pollution from local factories have led to high levels of toxic chemicals such as arsenic and mercury in the lake. As the lake shrinks below roughly 4,196 ft,14 leaving these chemicals in the dry dust that remains, sediment-filled winds threaten to inflict severe health risks on the local population.\nThe lake’s decline also bears significance for a broad ecosystem. The Great Salt Lake has historically sustained a $60 million brine shrimp industry,15 but as the lake shrinks to below 4,191 ft in water elevation, an increased concentration of salinity threatens the brine shrimp ecosystem.16"

    "text": "Dust and Sediment\nPerhaps the most urgent concern for the decline of the Great Salt Lake is the exposure of toxic chemicals it introduces to the nearby community. As the lake continues to shrink, toxic chemicals such as arsenic are being exposed to wind, which can carry them into the surrounding areas where many people reside. This is a serious concern as exposure to high levels of arsenic can cause health problems such as skin lesions, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.\nThe animation in Figure 3 demonstrates the process of this phenomenon very clearly.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: 3D model of the Great Salt Lake, illustrating the water elevation for every month for which there is recorded data (April 1966 - April 2023). As the water elevation decreases, large areas of land become exposed to open air–no longer submerged underwater. Pay particular attention to the lakebed exposure on the southeast and northwest ends of the lake. Without water to cover the toxic chemicals sitting on the lakebed, they run the risk of being carried into the surrounding community by the wind.\n\n\n\nMuch of the lakebed is already exposed to the open air at the time of writing and has been exposed for the last several years. Some evidence17 suggests that arsenic, one of the toxic chemicals high in the Great Salt Lake, has already spread to outlying neighborhoods in the form of dust and sediment.\n\n\n\n                        \n                                            \n\n\nFigure 4: Bubble map of arsenic levels around the Salt Lake Valley, circa 2018-19. Some sites contained multiple samples; thus, multiple bubbles are shown in same locations. The spread of high arsenic samples shows that arsenic-ridden dust has already spread from the lake.\n\n\n\nFigure 4 shows that levels of arsenic in the exposed dust near the lake is roughly equal to the levels of arsenic in neighborhoods miles away from the lake. For example, a sample at the “Lehi residential area” site recorded arsenic levels of 26.16 PPM, roughly equal to the 25.04 PPM of arsenic recorded at the “North playa near UT Test and Training Range” site much closer to the lake. This suggests that the spread of these chemicals may have already begun, and that the worst may be yet to come."

    "section": "Brine Shrimp",
    "text": "Brine Shrimp\nAside from posing a public health concern, the decline of the Great Salt Lake has significant implications for the brine shrimp population and the entire ecosystem that depends on it. Brine shrimp are an important part of the lake’s food chain and play a critical role in maintaining the lake’s ecosystem.\nBrine shrimp are a unique species that thrive in the high salinity waters of the Great Salt Lake. They are an essential source of food for many bird species, including the American Avocet, Wilson’s Phalarope, and the Eared Grebe, which rely heavily on brine shrimp during their migrations.\nThe decline in the lake’s water level has led to a reduction in the brine shrimp population, which has a ripple effect on the entire ecosystem. Birds that rely on brine shrimp as a food source may have to find alternative sources of food, or they may not be able to sustain their populations, leading to a decline in bird species diversity. Additionally, the decline of brine shrimp populations can affect the lake’s water quality, as they play a role in consuming organic matter in the water, helping keep the lake clean.\nFurthermore, brine shrimp are commercially significant. They are harvested from the lake and sold as food for fish farms and aquariums. The decline in the brine shrimp population has led to a reduction in the number of shrimps that can be harvested, which affects the livelihoods of those who depend on this industry.\nFigure 5 illustrates the reality that a smaller lake yields fewer brine shrimp. Since 2020, the number of young brine shrimp (juveniles and nauplii) in the lake has steadily declined. This decline corresponds to a significant period of decline in the lake’s water elevation, resulting in higher salinity levels in the lake which are unfit for brine shrimp habitation (see Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\nFigure 5: Linked view of brine shrimp sample counts for every recorded brine shrimp harvest from 2010-2023.18 Select a section of the line plot on the left to view the average brine shrimp counts for the selected harvest on the right. Cysts are defined as dormant brine shrimp eggs. Nauplii are defined as larva brine shrimp, which are younger than juveniles. During the 2010-11 harvest, nauplii were very highly concentrated in the lake (at about 3.6 per liter of lake water). Today, (in the 2022-23 harvest), they are far more scarce occurring at about 0.25 per liter of lake water.\n\n\n\nThe story of Figure 5 suggests the impending fall of several important systems that the Great Salt Lake sustains. A complete loss of the brine shrimp in the Great Salt Lake would trigger the death of thousands of migratory birds, erase countless jobs, and negatively impact the local economy."

Two of the major ramifications to the lake’s decline are exposure of toxic elements to the nearby population and the loss of environmental and economic systems supported by the lake’s brine shrimp. Researchers, legislators, and others have proposed many solutions to save the lake, but the highly complicated balance of systems in the lake has made this challenging. Establishing legislation that enacts major water conservation efforts is seen as the most viable solution, but this process must begin soon in order to ensure the lake’s survival."

    "text": "Photo by Paolo Villanueva. IG: @itspaolopv.\n\n\nAbout a year and a half ago I had the idea to start a blog. I wanted to get more practice creating data visualizations by diving into topics I’m interested in. Maybe I could create visualizations based on the script of my favorite TV series, Twin Peaks, uncovering new observations about the characters based on their dialogue. Or maybe analyze the most common LEGO brick colors across different set themes. I could even examine differences between Leo Tolstoy’s fictional vs. non-fictional writing, or illustrate how his favorite themes change throughout his writing career.\nI’m still interested in all these ideas, but I tend to undertake projects and then never finish them. In fact I usually don’t even get to the undertaking phase—I tend to just plan future projects until the plans grow so big that I get overwhelmed and abandon them. That’s what has happened with these ideas. So with my wife Sophie’s encouragement, I am starting this blog with one of her ideas so it remains safe from my reckless imagination.\nOn July 23, 2024, Sophie attended Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour in Hamburg, Germany. Since then, I’ve been exposed to the excited “clowning” of Swifties via Sophie’s For You Page on TikTok. Taylor leaves subtle hints about her next steps hidden throughout her concerts. She invites her fans to hunt for these hints, separating the red herrings from the real cues for what’s to come. Sometimes the hunt is successful, but sometimes the misdirections, whether intentional or not, make the fans look like clowns (hence the term “clowning”).\nOne particular area of interest for the Swifties is the outfits Taylor wears on her Eras Tour. It seems that some of her hints may hide in the number of days, shows, etc. between certain outfits. Taylor wears different outfits for the different eras throughout her shows, so there’s plenty to examine here. My project begins with the T-shirts she wears in the RED era.\n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\nI hope this blog will be a space for many more finished visualizations in the future. My aim is to post one visualization per week on any variety of topic. I might stick with Taylor Swift for a bit, because there’s no shortage of clues to analyze and the Swifties need my help.\nSpecial thanks to Nick Braun (@nicksversion on TikTok) for carefully collecting Taylor’s outfit data throughout the Eras Tour. I used Nick’s spreadsheet to create this visualization and couldn’t have done it without them!"
